3) What I have done in the assignment: Implement two servers using UDP and one client using TCP through one mainserver by socket programming 
4) What my code files are and what each one of them does. 
- servermain.cpp: pass message between server and client
- serverA.cpp: store the information in dataA.txt, wait for servermain processes, and reply the recommendation information
- serverB.cpp: store the information in dataB.txt, wait for servermain processes, and reply the recommendation information
- client.cpp: ask the user to input a country name and user id
5) The format of all the messages exchanged
- a file descriptor sockfd which is created after socket function
- message content
- length of the message
- flags, which is set to zero
