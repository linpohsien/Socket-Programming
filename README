What I have done in the project: Implement two servers using UDP and one client using TCP through one mainserver by socket programming 
What my code files are and what each one of them does. 
- servermain.cpp: pass message between server and client
- serverA.cpp: store the information in dataA.txt, wait for servermain processes, and reply the recommendation information
- serverB.cpp: store the information in dataB.txt, wait for servermain processes, and reply the recommendation information
- client.cpp: ask the user to input a country name and user id
Reused Code: most the the code in the project is modified from Beejâ€™s Guide to Network Programming
